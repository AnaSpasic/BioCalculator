# BioCalculator

A simple GUI application that enables users to execute fundamental operations on DNA sequences, including calculating GC content and performing transcription to RNA sequences.

To utilize the application, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Subsequently, open a BioCalculatorGUI.py script with any Python editor of your choice and execute it. The following graphical user interface will then appear on your screen:

Using the application is simple. Start by selecting your preferred dataset from the Datasets folder in the repository. Then, choose a sequence for either retrieving information like GC content and nucleotide frequency or transcribing it into an RNA sequence. All these functions are defined in the DNASequence class within the DNASequence.py script, also located in the repository.
